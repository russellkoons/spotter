trainingspotter is an app to create an easy to use weightlifting journal. I was at the gym, looking at the ratty, old notebook that I use to keep track of how much I'm lifting and it hit me. There has to be an easier way! 

trainingspotter lets you build specific routines and gives you already filled in forms the next time you do that routine. If you're repeating a routine and not changing any of the weight then you can make a new entry in just a few clicks!
